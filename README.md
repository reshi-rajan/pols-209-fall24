![data_error_2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fad155a2-c708-4232-9a0e-7845622a08ea)


This repository contains course materials for my TA sections (902 & 907) for POLS 209. In this class, we learn how the basics of research design and methods in Political Science. In the lab sections I host on Fridays, we will use R and RStudio to work with data. Each week we will have an in-class activity we do for lab where I walk you through R code to teach you how to do your lab reports. Once we are done with class, I will post an answer key for each in-class activity. This code will remain here for you all to access throughout the semester and once our time in class is over.
